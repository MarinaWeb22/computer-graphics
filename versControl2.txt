$ touch versControl2.txt
$ git add versControl2.txt
$ git commit -m "comment here"
$ git push origin main
$ git status
$ git pull origin main   (If a default branch is different than main (master: check in repo),
                          you will need to specify the branch name. If there is only one branch
                          then the branch name can be ommited.)
